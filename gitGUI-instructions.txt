After downloading the git-scm package for Windows you should have an app called GitGUI accessible from the start menu.

Start the app and choose close a repository

Enter the URL of the repository you want to have local access to

Choose a location on your local machine to put it, navigate into the parent directory and then give a folder name but DO NOT create the new folder yourself

Click the button to clone the repository

*** use local software to implement any changes ***

Back in GitGUI Click the "Rescan" button in the lower right panel

The upper left panel shows a list of all changes, select the ones you want to commit to the repository and click the button labeled "Stage Changed"

The item should move from the upper left window to the lower left window
