
** Please Note: these three configuration files are all python things that need done for officially releasing a package
** This was my plan on how to cover it in class, but I'm having second thoughts about that as the plan was to do it near beginning while still creeping github features in slowly at the end of each lecture
** if you check that link on line 10 it puts the package on one of Python's official channels rather than on github
** there are non-empty __init__.py files in some of my plugins for blender, I think my github has a couple of those


<< create python modules >>
<< set up repository >>

create a file called __init__.py in the folder containing the python modules and leave it empty
create files pyproject.toml and setup.cfg at the top level of the repository (see example at https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)


once all the files are in place use pip to install it
    pip install git+https://<<url.git>>@branch#egg=package_name



***Yeah... I may not show this in class, cloning repository and appending to sys.path is so much easier than those config files
