
<< create python modules >>
<< set up repository >>

create a file called __init__.py in the folder containing the python modules and leave it empty
create files pyproject.toml and setup.cfg at the top level of the repository (see example at https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)


once all the files are in place use pip to install it
    pip install git+https://<<url.git>>@branch#egg=package_name



***Yeah... I may not show this in class, cloning repository and appending to sys.path is so much easier than those config files
