After a couple years of teaching software development courses it finally dawned on me that GitHub would be an excellent place to store the classroom examples, especially since the students in many of my classes will have to submit their projects via a repository, might as well get some practice with it. 

For class examples I will use a bash terminal (Chromebook), zsh terminal (Macbook), Powershell host/Command Prompt/Git-Bash terminal (Windows) to pull down the repository, work through the in-class example, and push it back up so they'll have quick access to the examples and witness the power of a repository over other forms of cloud based storage. 

We might as well be using Google Drive and hit the share button with the limited coverage repository has been getting in my software development courses.

Oh yeah, and obviously we'll use the GitGUI from time to time too for those who would rather click with their mouse after long stretches of typing code (and get all those color coding and organizational benefits that comes with a GUI).
