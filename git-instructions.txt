These instructions should work in a bash or zsh terminal by default, once you run the installer for git on a Windows machine (which includes the GitBash terminal) these commands should work in cmd or powershell as well -worst case add the git installed files location to the PATH environment variable manually.

create a local folder to put the repository and navigate into it
    command: mkdir folder-name
    command: cd folder-name


Initialize the folder to git
    command: git init

OPTIONAL: I personally switch to just work with the main branch, the default behavior is to create a new one to merge later (I don't make main the default working branch though, just switch to it for the session)
    command: git branch -m main


Sync the local folder to the repository
    command: git remote add origin <<URL to Repository, copy from green button on repository homepage>>


OPTIONAL: confirm fetch and push are available
    command: git remote -v


Now you're ready to go ahead and download a clone of the repository to make sure things get located correctly (if you did not change the branch name you are on a branch called "master" instead of "main" here)
    command: git pull origin main


*** MAKE CHANGES TO THE REPOSITORY FILES ***
    -copy and paste new files to this folder
    -edit files with local software
    -overwrite/append/modify the stuff in the repository
    -etc....



Add the git to the local folder --a single dot refers to the current directory make sure you are at the directory level where you linked to your repository
    command: git add .



give the commit a meaningful name to track the changes
    command: git commit -m "A Meaningful Name"



If it's the first time you'll get an error here, use the email you set up your GitHub account with, for example mine was...
    command: git config --global user.email "francis.chris5@gmail.com"



push the changes to GitHub (if you didn't change the name earlier your branch should be called "master" instead of "main" here)
    command: git push origin main

Enter your GitHub username and token (passwords are no longer accepted but the token goes in password field)

If you need a token or OAuth (better for Windows or Mac) go to this page: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token and follow the instructions there
save the token someplace safe and copy it in for the password field (if you're not used to bash terminals you won't see anything typing or pasting to a password input be careful not to double paste it)


OPTIONAL: I always like to delete the local files to avoid confusion from multiple copies (multiple working copies not backup copies), git write protects the folder so use admin access to delete. For the example here, up one level and "folder-name" is where the repository was pulled down to.
    command: cd ..
    command: sudo rm -r folder-Name
          ** that's bash, for Windows Command Prompt: del foldername --> confirm --> rmdir folder-name, for powershell: remove-item -path folder-name -recurse (if it gives errors you're not in a terminal with admin privileges so either open one that is or use file explorer to delete it)
